Solution 1: Wishlist Bot
published demo site: https://myntra-hackerramp-weforshe.onrender.com/

** The files relative to this solution(wishlist bot) are present in the main(this) branch . **
We have proposed the idea of a Wishlist Bot within the 

wishlist section, which will help us design a full outfit and get a preview of it.

It allows users to scroll through the various section and get a idea of how the different items of clothes will look together as a outfit.

“Just play around with the random button feature of the Wishlist Bot until you get

 the outfit of your choice”

Solution 2: Style Box

** The files related to this solution(style box) are present in the style-box branch. **
Style Box is a gateway for the people to get the outfit of their choice just by mentioning the details they want.

It makes the process of choosing and selecting clothes a way easier as all you need to do is to fill all your preferences in a form and get the outfits ready in the cart as per your choice filled. The hustle to upload a picture of the aesthetic one by one is reduced by the multiple uploads option.

Also, you don’t have to burn up you head for the gifts you want to give to your loved ones,

“Just fill the form and gift them the outfit of their choice”
